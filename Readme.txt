The newsvendor (or newsboy or single-period or perishable) model is a mathematical model in operations management and applied economics used to determine optimal inventory levels.
It is (typically) characterized by fixed prices and uncertain demand for a perishable product.
If the inventory level is  q, each unit of demand above q is lost in potential sales.
This model is also known as the newsvendor problem or newsboy problem by analogy with the situation faced by a newspaper vendor who must decide how many copies of the day's paper to stock in the face of uncertain demand and knowing that unsold copies will be worthless at the end of the day.
This model is written in Python
